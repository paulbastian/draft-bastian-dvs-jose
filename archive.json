I might humbly suggest that you revisit how the header parameters are used to better align with how they are already defined in JWS. Specifically, I think the standard JWS headers https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515#section-4.1 like kid/jwk/x5c/x5t/etc should be for indicating the key of the Generating Party, which is really like the signer in this case. And a new header be defined to convey the Verifying Party's key. What's in draft-bastian-jose-alg-ecdh-mac-01 currently feels kinda backwards from what JWS has. And the Generating Party's key is probably not going to be ephemeral in most cases so epk doesn't seem quite right.\r\n\r\n> Thanks for the feedback @bc-pi\r\n> The header names were the part that I was least sure about, I oriented on the ECDH-ES part of JWA. But I don't mind changing them, feel free to open an issue on the repo!",
